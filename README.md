# Cyberpunk 2020 background generator

When I first got into [cyberpunk 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_(role-playing_game)) I was faced with
that most of the time was occupied by the generation of the character's backstory.
I started looking for characters generators and didn't find anything other than the [old designed generator](https://ericdorsey.info/cp2020/index.html)
So, I decided to write my own small generator with more modern interface

##About project
